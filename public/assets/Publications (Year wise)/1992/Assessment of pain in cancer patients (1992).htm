    <TD>ABSTRACT: Over the years, pain assessment remains a difficult clinical 
      problem due to its subjective and multidimensional nature. Accurate 
      assessment is essential for effective evaluation and management of cancer 
      pain. Various methods have been designed to quantify pain. Amongst them 
      the most commonly used being the Visual Analogue Scale, Verbal Rating 
      Scale, McGill pain questionnaire and the Memorial Pain assessment card. 
      These systems are basically subjective assessments and depend on patient's 
      statement, which in turn depends on the time of assessment, intelligence 
      and mood of the patient. Therefore a system of assessment of pain needs to 
      be designed which would be indirect without the conscious knowledge of the 
      patient. Pain suffered by a patient reflects on his daily activity, sleep 
      patterns and mood. The analgesic requirement of the patient is a good 
      indicator of the pain intensity. Thus, a scoring system has been designed 
      taking note of the pain intensity, frequency, type and frequency of 
      analgesic requirement, performance status, sleep disturbance and mood. 
      This scoring system gives us an easy,reliable and multidimensional 
      assessment of pain status of any patient subjectively and objectively.
